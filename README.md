Angular 19 PWA frontend for the Citizen Sphere, providing citizen and government portals for civic engagement.

**Built with:**

- Angular 19 with Standalone Components
- Angular Material Design
- Angular Signals for state management
- JWT Authentication with role-based routing
- PWA features with service worker
- Real-time geolocation services

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Backend API running on `https://localhost:7001`

### Development server

To start the development server:

```bash
npm install
ng serve --port 4202
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:4202/`. The app automatically reloads when you modify source files.

### Test Accounts

Use these pre-seeded accounts for testing:

**Citizens:**

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project for production:

```bash
ng build
```

This creates optimized build artifacts in the `dist/` directory, ready for deployment.
